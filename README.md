## My process

I studied the instructions and design before writing my HTML. I styled my HTML elements using a mobile-first workflow, starting at the top and working down through the sections.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was really good to revisit the position absolute and the z-index properties to position elements on top of one another.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to the next project and putting what I have been learning into practice.
